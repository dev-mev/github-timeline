# Github Timeline
Github Timeline accepts a Github username and produces a visual history of repositories they've created. It uses the Github GraphQL API (v4) and was built using Bootstrap and TypeScript with a Node.js/Express server. Try it out at https://mv-github-timeline.herokuapp.com/ (use "dev-mev" to see the developer's timeline.)

# Project Setup
In the project root run:
```
npm i
npm run start
```
